# Domino
This is Domino.
As you may know, this game is about joining bricks with dots from 1 to 6.
This project lets you play with the computer.
It displays your dominoes - if you want to make move, you simply pick the number on the list - if you want to add the piece on the left, don't forget to add minus sign ("-") before this number.
Important (and also quite obvious) thing is, your piece has two sides. If you will find the correct number in your domino, you don't have to worry, if it is not on the right side to meet the one on the table - it will be switched.
